# 🌐 Unity WebGL Build Pipeline (GitHub Actions CI/CD)
**Automated Unity WebGL build & deployment workflow using GitHub Actions, supporting both single-repo and cross-repo publishing.**

# 🎯 Overview

This repository demonstrates an automated pipeline for building and deploying Unity WebGL projects using **GitHub Actions**.

Originally designed for a **high school Game Design & Implementation course**, this workflow enabled students to publish playable WebGL builds while keeping their source code **private**. The build artifacts were deployed to a **separate public repo**, creating a secure classroom showcase site.

This portfolio version presents:

1. A simplified single-repository Pages deployment, and
2. Documentation on the original multi-repo private → public publishing pattern.
   
# 🚀 Features
* Unity WebGL automated build using GitHub Actions
* Zero local setup required — builds run fully in CI
* GitHub Pages automatic deployment (same-repo mode)
* Cross-repo deployment support (private project → public build repo)
* Configurable via GitHub Secrets (no hardcoded paths or credentials)
* Repeatable, educator-friendly workflow
* Scalable for classroom or team environments
