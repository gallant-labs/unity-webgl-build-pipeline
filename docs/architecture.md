# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project supports two deployment architectures:

---

## **1. Single-Repository Deployment (Portfolio Demo)**
(replace below with a prettier viso-type image)
Unity Project Repo
|
|
GitHub Actions Build
|
▼
gh-pages Branch
|
GitHub Pages Hosting

**Key Points:**
- Simplest to maintain  
- Ideal for demos & portfolios  
- No GitHub Secrets required  

---

## **2. Cross-Repository Deployment (Classroom Pattern)**
(replace below with a prettier image)
Private Student Repo
(Unity Project + Workflow)
│
▼
GitHub Actions Build
│
▼
WebGL Build Artifacts
│
▼
Public Build Repository
(GitHub Pages site)

**Why this pattern?**
- Keeps student code private  
- Allows public sharing of playable builds  
- Uses GitHub Secrets for secure repo-to-repo deployment  
- Scales cleanly to 20–30 students
